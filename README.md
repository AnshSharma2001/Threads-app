# Threads

## Introduction

Welcome to Threads, an interactive web application inspired by the Threads app by Facebook. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless communication experience, built using a modern tech stack including Next.js, React, MongoDB, TypeScript, and Node.js. With Clerk as our authentication service, we ensure a secure and user-friendly login process.

## Features

* Real-time messaging
* User authentication with Clerk
* Persistent data storage with MongoDB
* Sleek, responsive UI with React and Next.js

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or Yarn (latest version)
- MongoDB (local or remote)

## Installation

To get [Your App Name] up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-app-name.git
   cd your-app-name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-clerk-secret-key>
MONGODB_URL=<your-mongodb-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/onboarding
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

Make sure to replace `<your-clerk-publishable-key>`, `<your-clerk-secret-key>`, and `<your-mongodb-url>` with your actual Clerk and MongoDB credentials.

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application in action.

After installation, you can use the app to:
- Sign in/up using the Clerk authentication system.
- Engage in real-time conversations.
